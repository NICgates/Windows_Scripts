Computer Maintenance Strategy 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Yearly Computer and User Cleanup
  1. After a month into the school year, run a last login cleanup script. 
     If a user hasn't logged into a computer in less than delete their entire user directory. 
  2. If a user hasn't logged into any computer within the first month of school, as who's account is over a year old,
     then move that account into a Deactivated OU.
  3. If a computer hasn't been logged into that school year, and isn't a Spring Creek PC, then move it into a Deactivated OU.

- Monthly Computer Cleanup & Checkin
  1. Every month, delete unnecessary temp and cached data. 
  2. If a computer hasn't been online for a month, check if it's missing, who used it last, and if it works.
